Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

```blom
fun @native printf(format: string, ...) -> i32;

fun ahoj(a: i64) -> i64 {
    return a + 9;
}

fun @public main() -> i64 {
    return ahoj(7);
}
```
